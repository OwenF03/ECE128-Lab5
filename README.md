## Description

Design and test a multi segment driver for the four seven segment displays on the Basys 3 FPGA. The design was implemented and tested using AMD Vivado 2023.1.

## Instructions to run

Download all of the provided files and create a new project using AMD Vivado 2023.1. Add BCD_SEG.v and Multi_Driver.v as design sources, Basys-3-Master.xdc as a constraint file, and display_tb.v as a simulation source. Select the Xilinx Artic-7 FPGA (XC7A35T-ICPG236C) as the board. Ensure that Multi_Driver.v is selected as the top module for design sources, and display_tb.v is selected as the top module for simulation sources.
